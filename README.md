During the global pandemic, there is a sharp increase on demand of online grocery shopping, many major grocery retailers such as 
Metro, Walmart, shifted there business from in-person to online. Thus, there is also a big increase in demand to develop user-friendly,
modern website to faciliate customers' online grocery shopping.

This project is created and implemented with that idea in mind.

The front-end technologies used are: HTML,CSS,JavaScript
The back-end technologies used are: PHP

The purpose of the project is mainly to practice front-end development skills (there is minimal back-end technology involved).

and the other links to back store pages.
